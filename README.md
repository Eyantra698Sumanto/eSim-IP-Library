This repository contains various Open Source IPs which can be uploaded and used directly in eSim.

These IPs are released under the GNU GPL License.

# Digital-Verilog-IPs

The Digital IPs are developed using the Verilog/SystemVerilog/TL-Verilog HDL Programming.

The models present in this repository branch are developed by passing the Verilog Code through the NgVeri feature of eSim.

These IPs are meant to be used in the eSim Open Source Software developed by FOSSEE, IIT Bombay.

The Digital IPs are available at: https://github.com/Eyantra698Sumanto/eSim-IP-Library/tree/Digital-Verilog-IPs

# SKY130-Analog-IPs

The SKY130 IPs are developed using the SKY130 Open Source PDK.

These IPs are completely `Analog` and are built using the components present in the `sky130_fd_pr` libraries.

These IPs are meant to be used in the eSim Open Source Software developed by FOSSEE, IIT Bombay.

The Analog IPs are available at: https://github.com/Eyantra698Sumanto/eSim-IP-Library/tree/SKY130-Analog-IPs
