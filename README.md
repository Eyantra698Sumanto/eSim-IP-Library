This repository contains all various IPs which can be uploaded and used directly in eSim.

# Digital-Verilog-IPs

## About
The Digital IPs are developed using the Verilog/SystemVerilog/TL-Verilog HDL Programming.

The models present in this repository branch are developed by passing the Verilog Code through the NgVeri feature of eSim.

These IPs are meant to be used in the eSim Open Source Software developed by FOSSEE, IIT Bombay.

## How to use the IP?
- Download/Clone the `Digital-Verilog-IPs` branch of this repository.
- Run **eSim**
- Run **Makerchip-NgVeri** feature in eSim
- Open the Top Level Verilog File(same as the folder name) in **Makerchip Tab**
- For example:  The Top Level Verilog File for the `asyupcnt58` IP is `asyupcnt58.v`
- Switch to the **NgVeri  Tab**
- Click on the **Add Folder Button**
- A Dialog Box appears, Click on **Yes**
- Click on `Run Verilog to Ngspice Converter`
- If the model gets created successfully, a message will be displayed as **Model Created Successfully**
- Then, you can use the model in eSim to create a circuit in the **Eeschema**(eSim Schematic Editor)
